                    <h5 class="i_hf">What was our inspiration?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">Knowing that nutritional value of the foods we eat can help encourage individuals
                        all over the world to make healthier choices when it comes to eating. We decided that we wanted
                        to make a web application that would allow users to check the nutritionals facts of the foods
                        they'd eat all through the quick click of a few buttons.

                    <h5 class="i_hf">What does Fora do?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">Fora allows users to upload an image of a fruit or vegetable which is then compared
                        to our machine learning model. The machine learning model then detects what fruit or vegetable
                        is in the picture against 131 different fruits and vegetables and outputs the nutritional
                        information for the detected fruit or vegetable.

                    <h5 class="i_hf">How did we build Fora?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">The machine learning model was built and trained using Jupyter Notebook and PyTorch.
                        The model was trained using the Fruits 360 dataset on Kaggle:
                        https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits. The Edamam Nutrition API was integrated into our backend
                        using Python. The values were passed to our frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with
                        the framework Flask.</p>

                <div class="i_card">
                    <h5 class="i_hf">What challenges did we run into?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">This was our first time creating a machine learning model so there were lots of
                        challenges. One of the biggest ones was the wait time. The first cycle of our training took 5
                        hours and during that time, our team wasn't even sure if it was working or not. The dataset
                        contained over 90,000 images and unfortunately since we've never created a machine learning
                        model, we didn't know how long it would take. We initialized our model to train over 3 cycles so
                        that was 3x5 hours - 15 hours. Training it alone took a considerable amount of time since our
                        deadline was June 20 at 12am, about 30 hours to create our project. Aside from training, we also
                        had to spend some hours testing it, making sure the Edamam Nutrition API worked, and that our
                        website took in an image and outputted accurate information. Other challenges included working
                        with Visual Studio Code and their LiveShare extension. Allowing all of our teammates to access
                        the application cut into some of our time to build the application.</p>

                    <h5 class="i_hf">What accomplishments are we proud of?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">We're proud of creating a full web application, frontend and backend, and
                        integrating a machine learning model. After training our model, it achieved a 99.6% accuracy
                        rate against the training dataset. After spending a few more minutes testing it against the
                        testing dataset, it returned a 90% accuracy rate.</p>

                    <h5 class="i_hf">What did we learn?</h5>
                    <p class="i_pf">We learned a lot about machine learning. This was our first time creating a model so
                        we watched many tutorials and broke down each step with comments.</p>

                    <p class="i_pf">Some of the new and exciting plans we have for Fora is releasing a mobile version
                        since we are bound to reach a more diverse audience who may not have access to a laptop or
                        computer.</p>
